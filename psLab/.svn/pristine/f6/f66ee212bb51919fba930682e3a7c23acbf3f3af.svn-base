# A simple sh script for submitting one job to the npx3 cluster.
# Simply log into npx3.icecube.wisc.edu, run any command as you normally 
#  would but prepend "./submit-npx3.sh" and the command will be run on the
#  npx3 cluster.
#
# Eg #1:
# ./submit-npx3.sh root -l -b -q macro.C
# (NB: You must run in batch mode "-b" and quit root when macro is done "-q")
#
# Eg #2:
# ./submit-npx3.sh ./env-shell.sh python icetray_job.py
# (NB: You must execute env shell when submitting icetray jobs)
#
# This script will create directories to store your execution script, log files,
#  errors, and std output, so you need write permission in the local directory.

# This script creates a script to be executed and another script to submit it.
# The execution script must be available *at time of job execution!*, which may
#  not be until much later and so it's stored in a directory 'npx3-execs'.
# You may occasionally want to 'rm -rf npx3-*' directories if they get big.
# The submission script "2sub.sub" can be discarded immediately.

# This method of passing your job into a bash script as arguments may fail
#  if you have quotes or other special characters

#Quickest ever Condor tutorial:
#"condor_q" gives list of jobs running
#"condor_q $USER" gives list of your jobs
#"condor_rm $USER" removes your jobs 

  # Creating output directories
  mkdir -p npx3-execs npx3-logs npx3-out npx3-error

  # Creating execution script, do not delete until job has started!
  echo "#!/bin/bash" > npx3-execs/npx3-$$.sh
  echo "date" >> npx3-execs/npx3-$$.sh
